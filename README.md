# web-testing-selenium

### Description
I have created a selenium-based testing framework where I have used the https://www.toolsqa.com/automation-practice-form website as a template and have tested the different graphical user interface components using their field ids and field names. 

### Languages used
Ruby

### How to download
1. Copy/Clone the URL on GitHub
2. Open selected text editor
3. In selected text editor, open up in-built terminal and type 'git clone' followed by the URL copied from GitHub 

### How to run tests
1. Install gems using 'bundle install' in the terminal if gems in the gemfile are not already installed
2. Navigate to the root directory
3. Run rspec in your terminal 

### Challenges
1. Targeting individual elements within a drop down list using the field id
2. Creating a random generator to populate the fields with random data for more efficient testing purposes

### Learning points
1. Better understanding of using UI testing and how to target specific fields on a web browser
2. Greater knowledge of how to apply a random generator into testing
3. Better understanding on using the selenium module as a whole and all the methods to find elements within a web page
